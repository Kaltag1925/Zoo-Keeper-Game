# Zoo-Keeper-Game
A game I wanted to create inspired by the complexity of dwarf fortress.

Mostly broken now, due to not knowing about version control, though if need be, I can probably fix some of it.

Also none of this would have been possible if it weren't for my friend letting me constantly ask her for help :)
